## Problem Statement
### Analysis of Sales Performance Across Different Outlets and Item Types for Blinkit (India's Last Minute App)
The aim of this analysis is to explore and understand the sales performance across various outlet sizes, locations, and item types on Blinkit. 
The dashboard focuses on identifying key trends and patterns in total sales, the number of items sold, and average ratings, with special attention to fat content variations and the establishment of outlets over time.

Key metrics such as total sales, average sales, number of items sold, and customer ratings are examined by:
1. Outlet size and location (Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 cities)
2. Item types (e.g., Fruits, Snacks, Household, Frozen Foods, Dairy, etc.)
3. Fat content (Low Fat vs Regular)
4. Outlet type (Supermarket vs Grocery Store)
   
Additionally, insights into item visibility and outlet establishment trends from 2010 to 2022 are provided to assess market dynamics and outlet growth.
This analysis helps Blinkit optimize product offerings, identify the best-performing outlets and items, and refine customer engagement strategies based on item preferences and sales performance across regions.

## Suggestions:
1. Focus on Tier 3 Cities: Continue to invest in Tier 3 cities, as they contribute the largest share of sales, especially in regular fat content products.
2. Diversify Product Range: Increase visibility and promotion of lower-selling categories like seafood and breakfast items to boost overall sales.
3. Expand Medium-Sized Outlets: Since medium-sized outlets contribute the highest sales, consider expanding these locations for greater market penetration.
4. Enhance Low-Fat Product Marketing: Promote low-fat products more actively as they lag behind regular fat products in sales despite health trends.
5. Leverage Grocery Store Visibility: Utilize the high visibility of grocery stores to enhance their sales potential through targeted promotions and product offerings.
6. Maintain Stable Pricing Strategy: Keep average sales prices consistent across outlet types to maintain customer trust and predictability in pricing.
7. Monitor Outlet Growth Trends: Pay attention to outlet establishment patterns, particularly post-2018 declines, to address potential growth barriers.
8. Increase Engagement in Tier 1 and Tier 2: Focus on increasing sales in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, where market penetration is lower compared to Tier 3.
